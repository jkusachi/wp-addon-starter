## WP Theme Add On

### Description
A simple collection of files used to kick start a project to use some helpful development tools

- livereload
- jquery
- babel
- webpack
- sass
- gulp

You don't need to have this be specifically for Wordpress. It's only the case I'm using



### Installation

```
npm install -g webpack 		//install webpack if you dont have it 
npm install -g gulp   		//install gulp if you dont have it 
npm install 				//install packages
```
